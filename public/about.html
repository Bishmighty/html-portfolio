  I am a self-aware individual who is concious of the little time we have to spend on earth as humans and intends to make the best out of this time, giving the love I can wholly, appreciating the love I get in return. Family means a lot to me. Friends too; although I am not surrounded by too many of them. 
  It's been an interesting journey so far and ima glad to be here at the moment.
