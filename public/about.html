<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a young man with a lot of enthusiasm and drive for success. I am a goal-getter and focused on the important aspects of life. 
</p>

<p>
  I am a self-aware individual who is conscious of the little time we have to spend on earth as humans and intends to make the best out of this time, giving the love I can wholly, appreciating the love I get in return. Family means a lot to me. Friends too; although I am not surrounded by too many of them. 
  It's been an interesting journey so far and I'm glad to be here at the moment.

<p>
  Meanwhile, I am a Highly Experienced Full Stack Developer, ready to take on all your projects and deliver efficiently. That's all you need to know. So, I recommend you skip the other gibberish and focus on the last paragraph. Selah!
